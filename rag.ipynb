            "how does it feel being the new villain honestly I don't give a oh what a shot by demon one triple for demon one oh it's gorgeous we start it off as a season of misery ends in a season of infamy give it up for your 2023 world champions Evil Genius no one expected us to be here everyone counted as down and out and we became one of the best teams in the world demon one the Undisputed king of Hell in the world of valerant his name strikes fear into the hearts of his opponents with unparalleled skill and determination demon 1 has risen to the summit of Competitive Gaming earning the title of world champion in today's video we will be going over 40 times demon one proved that he's one of the best in the game so without any further delay let's dive straight into the video here we go get out of here Zappa from a great spot talk about it being a little uncontested he finds value uh first couple of blades Miss finally connect and Demon continues to push because of course he does why not surely don't expect him there bity decapitated take follow suit three on the round for demon one and the blades prove to be the differen maker as he's continuing to hunt continuing to look for more oxies he falls the ace on the cards hasn't connected yet whippy Shields but now at least it still sits in his hand oh oh what a shot by demon one another as he follows up and he's standing strong baiting kiwi in for more three quick kills they've heard him they finally have taken control of Heaven Les has cleared this one out but again time working against him you can start to hear it tick it's a wi face the way David one eviscerates them the pure gun skill is on display all the time you put a weapon in his hand like this ghost it just suits his tapping aim style so well elsewhere oh my God I say he was kept honest with the first jump Peak trigger and comm's consistent with it lets it Loose up in mid demon one of course he's going to be finding it but does he expect that I there's no shot that is just filthy me with the way that EEG is playing right right now Mind Freak playing with fire demon one comes away with two quick Taps the spray on the corpse he is here to shut this down a third kill now he continues his reign of terror demon one hath arrived something still trying to creep forward but it's going to be jamo taking it away so no chance at that Ace able to find the punish but it's going to be as good as it could possibly get as well as demon one close out another pistol round win Two Pistols now com T rex going to have to dial up something crazy they going to go for a force by is my question probably not it looks like not quite enough money not enough damage assist Potential from booo here with that operator see if they can kind of sus this out the in the tower showstopper drawn out but they do not suspect it whatsoever Buzz will find boo but the shutd down is there demon one with two drops the smoke that's Spike now stranded in arcade what a Cascade of tragedies here for DRX SM again coming down but he spots the Rays before the bloom swings on the corner and he's on for the ace zest lingering above he spotted and he's got it 6 to one off the back of the ace demon one shuts it down or a duelist he is absolutely phenomenal 11 And1 right now for demon and one on this map just beautiful out of charges one enemy remain and obviously I mean not not even at the fault I mean the shots are just nasty not even at the fault to buzz but it's the decision to go through there it is utility now irrelevant EDG just have to try and stand deliver with a lot less demon one first on in they try and clear through looks for the next Target oh it's gorgeous demon one this guy is something else can you answer it again being commanded oh my word what a monster a smoggy rings out the dinner bell and it ain't an ace looking to fish him out though he's going to be getting the call now and Spott it this position is it more than one for maybe demon one it is oh three the triple for demon one holds down the B site keeps a little over is not there the train tonight extension of it into the round here up draft up top and te one is eager for it trying to take the jaw but fully blinds it up narrowly avoiding 70 Health to his name a slight tap but demon one's too good it's 12 to8 took a lot to get him there focusing three players early towards eight it's a long rotation it is it's a long way off and look at demon one he's on a tear and chichu might be on the plat he is steon one picking up where he left off being low it's not impossible okay demon one okay the crowd are calling he's got 5 HP demon one might be answering one more how on with the sheriff demon one prowling spotted he's going to lose one they letting him do it demon one AC I'm going to advance forward just trying to creep away knives out demon One initial cont managing to find one will get theame but there's no way to punish him in the me going to be taken out as com come swinging out over the top a falling forsaken guns down to answering back now to buy finding another just keeping them in this Advantage demon one needs to go demon mode finds himself a second gets in on Spike a quick tap the op shot not going to be connecting something now pulling out Blades of his own want to try to push up against the wall but demon one takes the fight to him guns him down J now holding on to this one it's demon one he's keeping Mind Freak busy he's on his Lonesome he's chasing around the back and they're just running out of time a monstrous round here from demon one to get the MasterCard dripped and a pace change for EG after a very slow meticulous start to the pistol they've shifted gear a little looking to try and test or at least posture towards middle at the very beginning taking over towards the top side of things to oh come on this guy is literally inhuman I don't know what this man is made the zero point actually does catch on Aang really makes it feel like there's a lot in a m instead of Art plenty of players on the other side of this one TR Blazer that's going to be the trigger demon one gets out of there he went back for the repak yeah he really did one more kill and he's got his Dash back he wants even more they're going to give it to him three kills on for the ace Spike drop down those he loud not keen to give this one up J going for the plant now it's spammed was parted for heaven right through the smoke this is it on the cusp of it all it's up to them demon one got to land it got to hit it an extension for it he's bought a Lifeline great and they haven't fully access to the site look at the flank it's on the way this is where the danger is going to come in boo seems all to aware but the stuns in they're in danger loud now closing them down they don't have any safety to P back to so they take the fight and as perfect positioning punishing two cine there but Dem one he's still alive a one V2 he's got to know where sadak is two he's maybe a little bit harder to pin down he's only got 14 seconds to find this how much does he get jump spot spots one it's not a comfortable plant he's going to get it down for now closing the Gap though you got to respect this man a danger a danger through through demon one is in the server disgusting run it back me rolling back me right now cuz this I thought this was wrapped Mike I thought this was wrapped it should be I mean you can see now set up even at the first smoke being invested look to execute this flank what it's doing that to Ethan what's he going to be doing to rest of them baring forward straight down cat taking a by turn but reset demon one he's out for blood he's hunting for more he has to deny finds the first main compromise this way that way dashing forwards TPS abound what is going on two it's all over the place man Anarchy a wide swing from ma wi face so dangerous dropping down smoke at his feet demon one with the knives all the way through he lands the first into the way finds the second will it be the finisher flash through ABB will not be able to do it scattering with the guns really a full purchase from paperex but a smoke to cut them across again going back to the fast Place Dash into the smoker pulls to counter and what a counter it is bait them in strike them back hammer and Anvil style the two entry players I mean Jing and forsaken they can get nothing done the paing there dropping down into hell there was a pull prior and at this point it's just an absolute aim Labs routine Flawless rounds everybody keeping the guns going might that is double duelist versus double duelist you don't often see the Rays and the Jet working together with this composition to defend the a site but this has been an adjustment that EG have gone for in this match J is not playing towards male or you know to get that utility down close smokes towards the a site yes you're going to have one put back by twoes but that's fine the flank may have lost a little bit of it punch to it because they're still going to be in the post and they've all opted to basically sit on sight excluding one that's demon one here stunned up tries to Fall Away find a safer position loud and knocking at the door now stunned to follow he's in danger needs some help Ethan can't do it as fast is there loud trying to get dangerous here demon one sh this guy is monstrous Corner Ethan's going to trade out Leo it ain't over yet but maybe Chronicle Maybe not maybe it's demon one he's got the knives out a 2 to Alpha and Chronicle to try and get fnatic across the line oh God he's trying to save them but it's Alpha up against demon now oh my God God this guy is out of this world the kbg in this map three crisp as hell one enemy remaining you don't you don't do this oh my God thing because there is that null command available for Stacks there's a turret ready and waiting now smoke drop down flash as well demon one that's just reactions anticipating the swing and that's just fire man we've got what looks like a bit of a mid- crunch between demon one and booo they're just going to look for picks here I think oh demon one he's not messing around man so fast out top M being held paranoia so deep what is that what a they're just choosing to play full retake with nomand yeah Ethan's got that one lets it Loose pushing them back no util to be used in this instance already just starting to flood the way back into the site has to be the big moments demon one this guy is just spectacular it's three for him to buy he's left towards main but not for much longer they have five opportunities now to be able to head to a grand finals rematch and the anime ha could continue them a second shot at taking down the Titan players are weak you can understand why no command now waves emanating catching no util to be used but demon one has immediately shut that one down Heavens watched for too many layers to it 11 and four taking over in the server I mean look at that oh so confident it's only a marshall on the other side and had it been an operator fors would have landed The Kill that's ridiculous though these shots are just insane didn't catch it initially but as soon as I heard the dash and the kill feed light up I was like okay well this guy's on it he's locked in and now up V up cover going Up's G some of the space back they've lost garage there's at all he's going to okay that was very close either way they still haven't fully gotten out onto the site Comm getting the opener 13 seconds left they burn the clock down as demon one gets up high and gets the second oh demon one with the Third fua falling good from Ethan shots better from DG oh my gosh what was that how one enemy he's not done man he's not done oh he's gone right by them oh my goodness he just team flashed himself it's all a setup it's all set up for the blades there it is demon one gets all five no charges left I'm looking at the a-hole as well well demon one sets up here he does not have Dash anymore he doesn't have help he does not have help and it does not matter I mean I'm buying it now I'm buying it now nearly got it he's caught though there needs to be that bail out and well team one might be the guy to do it deep smoke position from K grants him that no cheering through the smoke please there we see it demon one still holding it Landing it four kill yes get these trade off but here's the hit on a 23 seconds on the clock the head shot from demon one on the S looking for the plant down but it's up to crashies alone it's demon one with a do chichu has 100% spotted them to slow things down once again here there demon one to find it a minute K Kang on the site with an operator one Flash and a missed shot an opportunity Seekers coming through is this really going to happen eventuality feels that nobody will get here but he's not there yet the Seeker should show enough prob being look at demon one he's actually staying late Ethan solo pushing side get out of it get out of it are you serious yes this is this is so dangerous and the timing on this look at where demon one is pathing to look at the timing on this Ethan is just a distraction if he gets the spike down that's perfect but it's so much pressure demon one from the depths of Hell takes out smoggy and now the 2v2 but again remember nobody Ethan Are You Are you seriously considering this absolutely turns around at the right time howong try to clear through they're trying to slip away they got 70 seconds there's no time they have to commit they have to commit where where do they clear is it CT is it B main 10 seconds out make your mind PL going to come in Demon one has to keep him safe here and for EDG they TR to build back through howong first fight he's got it it's all on demon one and he's getting aggressive demon one fully Unleashed bulldozers in takes out howong claims a little bit of safety in CT but he's got nobody on the other side no flash there just yet but this would be insane demon one alive and well that is one of the wildest Red Bull clutches I think we've seen so far the way they move around the map M call it a clutch but between him and Ethan the timings it's another example just a half second here and there\n"
